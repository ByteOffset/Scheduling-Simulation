# Scheduling-Simulation
Simulates a 100 second period during which tasks are initiated at random intervals based upon a given level of probability. Tasks are then executed for an amount of time based upon their priority and necessary duration. At the end of the 100 second period a final report is generated detailing the number of jobs that completed, the average time left of the unfinished jobs, and more.
